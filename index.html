<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p><img src="./profile.jpg" class="profile" /> Subham stumbled upon his
interest in ECE serendipitously while studying Aerospace Engineering,
realizing that the world of signals and communications held a greater
fascination for him. He earned his B.Tech in ECE from the Indian
Institute of Space Science and Technology. Currently, his research
interests include wireless communication and networking systems.
Subham’s extensive prior experience includes designing multiple access
schemes for massive MIMO communications applications and software
development for embedded systems. Beyond academia, he describes himself
as a fun-loving ambivert, occasionally indulging in playing the ukulele,
singing, and socializing. He also plays badminton and table tennis at a
level slightly beyond beginner. His love for the outdoors extends to
treks, hikes, and activities like running and swimming.</p>

the Relationship Between Mean Absolute Error and Age of Incorrect
Information in the Estimation of a Piecewise Linear Signal Over Noisy
Channels</h2>
<p>We consider the remote estimation of a stochastic piecewise linear
signal, observed by a sensor, at a monitor. The sensor transmits a
packet whenever the observed signal’s slope changes. The packets are
transmitted from the sensor to the monitor through an unreliable channel
which randomly loses packets. The monitor sequentially estimates the
signal using the information obtained from successfully received
packets. The sensor does not have any feedback from the monitor. We
derive an analytical expression for the average age of incorrect
information, a recently proposed information freshness metric. The
average age of incorrect information is shown to be a function of
success probability of transmission and signal parameters representing
the rate and clustering of slope changes. We obtain an upper bound on
the mean absolute error of the remote estimate using the slope-weighted
age of incorrect information. The age of incorrect information is also
studied for a homogeneous multisensor scenario, where sensors use
slotted ALOHA and the links between the sensors and the monitor are
unreliable due to contention.</p>
<h2
id="on-the-minimum-average-age-of-information-in-irsa-for-grant-free-mmtc">On
the Minimum Average Age of Information in IRSA for Grant-free mMTC</h2>
<p>We consider the optimal design of the frame-based irregular
repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol for minimizing the average age
of information (AAoI) in grant-free massive machine-type communications
(mMTC). To this end, we first characterize the AAoI as a function of the
number of UEs, the frame duration, and the repetition distribution of
IRSA. We present this characterization for IRSA schemes with packet
recovery at the end of frame and packet generation either at the
beginning of the frame or just in time before first transmission in a
frame. We also propose and characterize the AAoI of a novel early packet
recovery method which further reduces the average age of information. In
all cases, the analysis reveals that, as a function of normalized
channel traffic (defined as the ratio of number of UEs to frame
duration), the AAoI first decreases linearly due to more frequent
updates received from the UEs, and increases sharply beyond a critical
point due to packet recovery failures caused by collisions. We then
consider the problem of minimizing AAoI by optimizing over the
normalized channel traffic and repetition distribution for all the
proposed sampling and recovery schemes. The optimization problem is
challenging since the objective function is semi-analytical and can only
be completely characterized using simulations. In an asymptotic regime
where the number of UEs as well as the frame size is large, we
characterize the AAoI using upper and lower bounds. We also obtain a
locally optimal normalized channel traffic and repetition distribution
using differential evolution. Based on the insights obtained from the
asymptotic analysis, we also propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a
normalized channel traffic and repetition distribution for AAoI
reduction in the non-asymptotic case. Finally, we empirically show that
our AAoI minimizing schemes outperform conventional throughput optimal
schemes.</p>

Simple Digital Interface Circuit for Giant Magneto-Resistance
Sensors</h2>
<p>Giant Magneto-Resistance (GMR) sensor-elements are usually configured
in a Wheatstone bridge form. In this work, a new simple interface
circuit with a microcontroller is proposed to identify the
fractional-resistance change of GMR sensor using the discharge times of
the capacitor. An Op-amp is used to avoid the effect of the mismatch of
unshielded-resistance of the GMR sensor. This method just uses three
conversion modes to make the output immune to the pin-resistance of the
microcontroller. Simulation and emulation studies of the proposed
interface are performed. A worst-case nonlinearity of 0.35% is observed.
A hardware model of the interface is tested with the GMR sensor and the
associated results are also reported in this paper.</p>
