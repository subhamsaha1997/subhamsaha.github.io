Subham stumbled upon his interest in ECE serendipitously while studying Aerospace Engineering, realizing that the world of signals and communications held a greater fascination for him. He earned his B.Tech in ECE from the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. Currently, his research interests include wireless communication and networking systems. Subham's extensive prior experience includes designing multiple access schemes for massive MIMO communications applications and software development for embedded systems. Beyond academia, he describes himself as a fun-loving ambivert, occasionally indulging in playing the ukulele, singing, and socializing. He also plays badminton and table tennis at a level slightly beyond beginner. His love for the outdoors extends to treks, hikes, and activities like running and swimming.

On the Relationship Between Mean Absolute Error and Age of Incorrect Information in the Estimation of a Piecewise Linear Signal Over Noisy Channels
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We consider the remote estimation of a stochastic piecewise linear signal, observed by a sensor, at a monitor. The sensor transmits a packet whenever the observed signalâ€™s slope changes. The packets are transmitted from the sensor to the monitor through an unreliable channel which randomly loses packets. The monitor sequentially estimates the signal using the information obtained from successfully received packets. The sensor does not have any feedback from the monitor. We derive an analytical expression for the average age of incorrect information, a recently proposed information freshness metric. The average age of incorrect information is shown to be a function of success probability of transmission and signal parameters representing the rate and clustering of slope changes. We obtain an upper bound on the mean absolute error of the remote estimate using the slope-weighted age of incorrect information. The age of incorrect information is also studied for a homogeneous multisensor scenario, where sensors use slotted ALOHA and the links between the sensors and the monitor are unreliable due to contention.

On the Minimum Average Age of Information in IRSA for Grant-free mMTC
---------------------------------------------------------------------
We consider the optimal design of the frame-based irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol for minimizing the average age of information (AAoI) in grant-free massive machine-type communications (mMTC). To this end, we first characterize the AAoI as a function of the number of UEs, the frame duration, and the repetition distribution of IRSA. We present this characterization for IRSA schemes with packet recovery at the end of frame and packet generation either at the beginning of the frame or just in time before first transmission in a frame. We also propose and characterize the AAoI of a novel early packet recovery method which further reduces the average age of information. In all cases, the analysis reveals that, as a function of normalized channel traffic (defined as the ratio of number of UEs to frame duration), the AAoI first decreases linearly due to more frequent updates received from the UEs, and increases sharply beyond a critical point due to packet recovery failures caused by collisions. We then consider the problem of minimizing AAoI by optimizing over the normalized channel traffic and repetition distribution for all the proposed sampling and recovery schemes. The optimization problem is challenging since the objective function is semi-analytical and can only be completely characterized using simulations. In an asymptotic regime where the number of UEs as well as the frame size is large, we characterize the AAoI using upper and lower bounds. We also obtain a locally optimal normalized channel traffic and repetition distribution using differential evolution. Based on the insights obtained from the asymptotic analysis, we also propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a normalized channel traffic and repetition distribution for AAoI reduction in the non-asymptotic case. Finally, we empirically show that our AAoI minimizing schemes outperform conventional throughput optimal schemes.

A Simple Digital Interface Circuit for Giant Magneto-Resistance Sensors
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant Magneto-Resistance (GMR) sensor-elements are usually configured in a Wheatstone bridge form. In this work, a new simple interface circuit with a microcontroller is proposed to identify the fractional-resistance change of GMR sensor using the discharge times of the capacitor. An Op-amp is used to avoid the effect of the mismatch of unshielded-resistance of the GMR sensor. This method just uses three conversion modes to make the output immune to the pin-resistance of the microcontroller. Simulation and emulation studies of the proposed interface are performed. A worst-case nonlinearity of 0.35% is observed. A hardware model of the interface is tested with the GMR sensor and the associated results are also reported in this paper.
