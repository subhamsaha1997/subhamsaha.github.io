** EDUCATION
*** Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Trivandrum, India 2016-2020
- Bachelor of Technology, Electronics and Communication Engineering
- CGPA: *9.62/10*

** PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
*** U. R. Rao Satellite Center, Indian Space Research Organization 2021-Present
**** Embedded Software Developer, Human Space Program
(Ada, GDB, Python, Gnuplot, GNU Make, Git/Gitlab)

- Implemented CCSDS space packet protocol to amplify single uplink capability *upto 8 times* in HX1750 based system.
- Developed a telemetry system for data acquisition from diverse interfaces (e.g. analog sensor, Mil1553B etc.), uniform parameter identifier assignment, and formatting data into CCSDS compliant frame structure for 8Kbps stream.
- Designed critical event monitoring system for failure detection, and fixed-priority command execution for recovery. Successfully *unit-tested* using *GNAT Debugger GDB* and integration-tested the failure mitigation scheme with time constraints under simulated stimuli.
- Conceptualized a simple EEPROM based command storage system for power on initialization which *reduced* the number of uplink required to program by *50%*.
- Established *version control*, and *CI/CD pipelines* using Gitlab for compiling and maintaining the code base.
- Developed scripts to parse Mil1553B bus-monitor logs into annotated database to automate testing, and timing verification.

**** Project Lead for RTOS
(C, GDB, FreeRTOS, GNU Make, Qemu, Git/Gitlab)

- Self-taught *FreeRTOS* kernel internals to implement *operating system* based task management to improve processor cycle utilization.
- Established remote debug facilities in emulated (QEMU) and target environment using *GNU Debugger*.
- Developed codebase for command reception and loopback in target environment.

** RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
*** Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 2020
Mentor: [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandra-murthy-6a67221/][Chandra R. Murthy]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/vineeth-b-s-56117274/][Vineeth B. S.]]
- Characterized *average age of information* (AAoI) in massive machine type communication for frame-based *irregular repetition slotted aloha* (IRSA) as function of users, frame duration, and repetition distribution for two cases of transmission: *beginning of the frame* and *just-in-time*.
- Proposed and characterized a novel *early packet recovery* method using successive interference cancellation in every slot of IRSA. The early recovery method achieves AAoI *54% less* than that of slotted ALOHA and *53% less* than CRDSA.
- Optimized normalized channel traffic and repetition distribution to *minimize AAoI* in asymptotic scenario and formulated practical method to reduce AAoI in non-asymptotic case which performs as closely as *12%* of the asymptotic value.
- Derived analytical expression and characterized *average age of incorrect information* for *remote estimation of a stochastic piecewise linear signal* over unreliable channel.

*** Jet Propulsion Lab, Pasadena  2019
Mentor: [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/clayton-okino-91709a2b/][Clayton Okino]]
- Developed a *spectrum analysis suite* in Qt to inspect wireless environment using Universal Software Radio Peripheral, GNU Radio, and UHD C/C++ API supported through SWIG.
- Incorporated visualization of spatial energy distribution, and location-tagging of the acquired samples.

*** Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Trivandrum  2017-2018
Mentor: [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/anoop-c-s-52b84122/][Anoop C. S.]]
- Designed a novel *microcontroller-based direct digital interface* circuit for *Giant Magneto-Resistance sensors* to measure magnetic field strength using discharge times of a capacitor in three different conversion modes to compensate pin resistance.
- Carried out *simulation and emulation studies* of the scheme to find worst case *non-linearity of 0.33% in simulation model and 0.35% in emulation model*.
